            <p>
            Web-Native is new and intends to be an open community for developers who are passionate
            about native languages, platform features and APIs. If that describes you, please feel free to
            join! Simply drop us a mail at <a style="color: blueviolet;" href="mailto:join@web-native.dev">join@web-native.dev</a>.
            (A formal onboarding process is yet to be established; and, no problem if you want to help with that.)
            </p>

            <p>
            We develop libraries, tools, and specifications that open up new possibilities on the web,
            starting at the platform level. We want anyone to be able to get more done with less dependencies!
            Our work aims to ease-out the limitations that has historically made this difficult.
            </p>

            <p>
            Keeping the lights on in the dark wake of COVID19 is not a trivial thing to do! The financial weight
            of the Web-Native project is currently already overwhelming! We however believe in the support of the opensource
            community to get by. We have a <a style="color: blueviolet;" href="https://patreon.com/ox_harris">Patreon campaign here</a> where you can easily drop us a stipend.
            We've also worked at rewarding your kind gesture with exciting perks.
