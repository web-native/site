# Web-Native.Dev
Hi dev, welcome to the vibrant, young community facilitating native web standards, languages and APIs through:
1. Evangelism
2. Developer tools

-------------------------------------------

We evangelise "web-native" development via articles, talks, conferences, meetups, trainings and workshops.

Find us in the [*evangelist* section](https://evangel.web-native.com), or support the paradigm shift and start a publication.

-------------------------------------------

We build tools that are consistent with the same "native" thinking and feeling, or at the very least, empower you to make success of "web-native" development.

[Find a tool](https://docs.web-native.dev), or be an [opensource contributor](https://github.com/web-native).

-------------------------------------------

This community has the mandate to bring order back to web development. Learn more about the problem [here >>](https://web-native.dev/manifesto)
